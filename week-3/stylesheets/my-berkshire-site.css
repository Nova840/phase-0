/*
Reflection:

What is important to know when linking an external file (like a stylesheet) to an HTML file?

	You use the <link> tag and you specify what kind of file you are linking and the relative path.

What tricks did you use to help you with positioning? How hard was it to get the site as you wanted it?

	It was a little difficult to get the site exactly as I wanted it. One trick I used was adding vertical-align:top; to the .left class.

What CSS did you use to modify the element style? (like size, color, etc.)

	I used font-size, color, display, margin, border, width, and height properties.

Did you modify the HTML to include classes or ids? If so, which did you choose and why? If you didn't, how would you know which one to add to your HTML?

	Yes, I mostly modified divs and spans with classes because classes are meant to be used multiple times.

When you compared your site to the actual code base, which do you think had cleaner code that followed best practices and why?

	I think our site used better practices because looking at the actual site's HTML you can see that they used a lot of empty paragraphs for spacing and it didn't have any CSS.
