// __________________________________________
// Reflection
/*

What did you learn about iterating over nested objects in JavaScript?

  I learned about how to use a for-in loop.

Were you able to find useful methods to help you with this?

  I found out about the isNaN function.

What concepts were solidified in the process of working through this challenge?

  One concept that was solidified was using bracket notation to access properties.
