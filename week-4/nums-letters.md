**How does Ruby handle addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of numbers?**

For addition, subtraction, and multiplication it is as you would expect, but for division it will give you an integer without the remainder for integer division and a float for float division.

**What is the difference between integers and floats?**

An integer is a number without decimal places and a float is a number with decimal places.

**What is the difference between integer and float division?**

The difference between integer and float division is with float division you can get a fraction as an answer and with integer division you get a remainder.

**What are strings? Why and when would you use them?**

Strings are characters strung together. You would use them when you need to make something that a user can read.

**What are local variables? Why and when would you use them?**

Local variables contain information like a string, integer, or float. You use them to remember data.

**How was this challenge? Did you get a good review of some of the basics?**

I didn't think this challenge was very difficult; it was mostly review.
