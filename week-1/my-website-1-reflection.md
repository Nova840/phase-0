**Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person.**

To create a repository, you need to log in to GitHub and click the button that says "+ New repository" in the upper-right. You would then copy the link it gives you to your repository. Then to clone it, you would open up your shell, go to where you want it cloned to, then type "git clone (URL you just copied)".

**Describe what open source means.**

Open source is when something is made free to modify and distribute.

**What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?**

I think open source is a good idea for some larger projects or teaching projects but it seems like for smaller projects it would be very easy for someone to steal your work.

**Assess the importance of using licenses.**

Using licenses is important because people have to know what they can use it for and how/if it can be distributed.

**What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?**

I feel like now I have a solid understanding of how to use git. I struggled with trying to get the files on GitHub and the files on my local machine to sync properly.

**Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.**

When I was having trouble using git/GitHub I had to search for resources on my own. I didn't keep track of what I was trying to find or what any of those resources were.
