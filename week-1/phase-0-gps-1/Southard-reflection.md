What git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session? <br>
I've definitely had issues keeping track of the branches that are open and which one I'm currently on. Sometimes I've had trouble remembering the syntax used to check where my current branch is compared to the master or the origin. <br>
What concepts were clarified during the GPS? <br>
The GPS helped a lot with some of the concepts I've had trouble with. Fetch and Merge were clarified as two different steps that could be more useful and informative than just blindly pulling a repo. I also got more familiar with the backside of GitHub and using it with multiple people rather than the simple streamlined version I've been doing on my own for the past couple weeks.
What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?<br>
I might need to do a better job of asking questions rather than just plowing ahead until I screw up, but they well both gracious enough to explain a bunch. I learned about the importance of creating a pull request and allowing other parties to review it before merging. I also re-learned a couple of more efficient syntax moves, like git checkout -b rather than creating a new branch and then checking out to it. <br>

What still confuses you about git?<br>
There is still a nebulous nature to git that I understand on a macrocosmic level, but when it comes to the forefront of maneuvering it, I get a little lost. I still have trouble keeping track of where I am within branches, and don't have a 100% grip on the backend of GitHub, but after this, I feel a lot better about it. <br>
How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?<br>
It was a little wild and a little intimidating, but it was very helpful to have a much more experienced programmer guiding the process. I don't know if my pair and I would have failed this exercise without help, but it easily would have taken twice as long without a few well-timed, constructive interjections.
