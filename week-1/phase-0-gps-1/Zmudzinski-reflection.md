**What git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?**

I wasn't struggling very much with git, but I had a little trouble keeping track of which branch I was making changes on.

**What concepts were clarified during the GPS?**

Merging using "git merge" was something I didn't quite understand until the GPS.

**What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?**

I remember asking for clarification of what the fetch and merge did compared to the pull command.

**What still confuses you about git?**

I wouldn't say I'm very confused about git right now, but there's probably still some stuff about git that I don't know.

**How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?**

It was pretty good. I had Internet problems for the first half, but after that it went pretty smoothly. I feel like we learned a lot from it.
