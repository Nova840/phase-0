###1.1 Think About Time Reflection

**Which time management and productivity ideas did you learn about?**

I learned that it is important to start small and divide up larger tasks into smaller pieces.

**What is "Time Boxing?" How can you use it in Phase 0?**

Time boxing is when you divide up a larger task into smaller tasks or "boxes". I can use this in Phase 0 to manage when I do work in the week.

**How do you manage your time currently?**

I currently manage my time by making sure I get at least a certain amount done per day.

**Is your current strategy working? If not, why not?**

My current strategy works for most things. I can sometimes lose focus if I don't want to do the task and it takes a lot longer.

**Can/will you employ any of them? If so, how?**

I could employ the idea of time boxing by keeping track of how long it takes me to finish tasks. I'm not sure if that would be very effective because different tasks take different amounts of time.

**What is your overall plan for Phase 0 time management?**

My current plan for time management has been working for me so far so I don't feel the need to change it.


###1.2 The Command Line Reflection


**What is a shell? What is "bash?"**

A shell is the interface where you type in commands. Bash is a shell.

**What was the most challenging for you in going through this material?**

The most challenging thing for me was understanding what "piping" was.

**Were you able to successfully use all of the commands?**

Yes.

**In your opinion, what are the most important commands and arguments to know?**

In my opinion, the most important commands/arguments to know are "cd" because you use that to move around, "ls" to tell what items are in the directory, and "help" to help you know what command to use.
 

**-pwd**: Tells you the directory you're in.

**-ls**: Lists items in the directory.

**-mv**: Moves a file.

**-cd**: Changes directory.

**-../**: Up a directory.

**-touch**: Creates a new Item.

**-mkdir**: Creates a new directory.

**-less**: Displays the contents of a file.

**-rmdir**: Removes a directory.

**-rm**: Removes a file.

**-help**: Gives you information about what you type after it.


###1.4 Forking and Cloning Reflection

**If you were going to write instructions for a new person on how to create a new repo, fork a repo, and clone a repo, what would they be? Why would you fork a repository as opposed to create a new one?**

You create a new repository by going to github.com], logging in, and clicking "+ New repository" at the upper-right of the page. You then enter a name for it and click the "Create repository" button.

You fork a repository by navigating to the repository that you want to fork, then clicking the "Fork" button in the upper-right and selecting where to fork it.

To clone a repository, you first go to the repository you want to clone and copy the clone URL. Then you open up a shell and navigate to the directory that you want to clone it to. After that, you type "git clone <URL>" to clone the repository.

You would fork a repository because creating a new one means starting from scratchâ€”forking gives you something to start with.

**What struggles did you have setting up git and GitHub? What did you learn in the process?**

I didn't struggle very much setting up git and GitHub. I learned how you make a repository and use GitHub.
